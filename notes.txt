90 minute cycles for REM sleep


if the wakeup time is EVEN then the REM cycle can be  



12 AM DOne
1AM




Add on the side of the box a little cute box that explains that sleeping for more than 10 hours can be dangerous 
and the an average Rem cycle is around 90 minutes



we need to figure out a better function for this -- it is too confusing right now to deal with

>> do a side quest and try to figure it out seperate to what is presently on the script.js
